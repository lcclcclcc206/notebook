中间件是一种装配到应用管道以处理请求和响应的软件。 每个组件：

- 选择是否将请求传递到管道中的下一个组件。
- 可在管道中的下一个组件前后执行工作。

请求委托用于生成请求管道。 请求委托处理每个 HTTP 请求。

使用 [Run](https://learn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.runextensions.run)[Map](https://learn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.mapextensions.map) 和 [Use](https://learn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.useextensions.use) 扩展方法来配置请求委托。 可将一个单独的请求委托并行指定为匿名方法（称为并行中间件），或在可重用的类中对其进行定义。 这些可重用的类和并行匿名方法即为中间件，也叫中间件组件。 请求管道中的每个中间件组件负责调用管道中的下一个组件，或使管道短路。 当中间件短路时，它被称为“终端中间件”，因为它阻止中间件进一步处理请求。

## Create a middleware pipeline with `WebApplication`

The ASP.NET Core request pipeline consists of a sequence of request delegates, called one after the other. The following diagram demonstrates the concept. The thread of execution follows the black arrows.

![Request processing pattern showing a request arriving, processing through three middlewares, and the response leaving the app. Each middleware runs its logic and hands off the request to the next middleware at the next() statement. After the third middleware processes the request, the request passes back through the prior two middlewares in reverse order for additional processing after their next() statements before leaving the app as a response to the client.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/middleware/index/_static/request-delegate-pipeline.png?view=aspnetcore-7.0)

Each delegate can perform operations before and after the next delegate. Exception-handling delegates should be called early in the pipeline, so they can catch exceptions that occur in later stages of the pipeline.

The simplest possible ASP.NET Core app sets up a single request delegate that handles all requests. This case doesn't include an actual request pipeline. Instead, a single anonymous function is called in response to every HTTP request.

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

app.Run(async context =>
{
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello world!");
});

app.Run();
```

Chain multiple request delegates together with [Use](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.useextensions.use). The `next` parameter represents the next delegate in the pipeline. You can short-circuit the pipeline by *not* calling the `next` parameter. You can typically perform actions both before and after the `next` delegate, as the following example demonstrates:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    // Do work that can write to the Response.
    await next.Invoke();
    // Do logging or other work that doesn't write to the Response.
});

app.Run(async context =>
{
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello from 2nd delegate.");
});

app.Run();
```

When a delegate doesn't pass a request to the next delegate, it's called *short-circuiting the request pipeline*. Short-circuiting is often desirable because it avoids unnecessary work. For example, [Static File Middleware](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/static-files?view=aspnetcore-7.0) can act as a *terminal middleware* by processing a request for a static file and short-circuiting the rest of the pipeline. Middleware added to the pipeline before the middleware that terminates further processing still processes code after their `next.Invoke` statements.

[Run](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.runextensions.run) delegates don't receive a `next` parameter. The first `Run` delegate is always terminal and terminates the pipeline. `Run` is a convention. Some middleware components may expose `Run[Middleware]` methods that run at the end of the pipeline:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    // Do work that can write to the Response.
    await next.Invoke();
    // Do logging or other work that doesn't write to the Response.
});

app.Run(async context =>
{
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello from 2nd delegate.");
});

app.Run();
```

In the preceding example, the `Run` delegate writes `"Hello from 2nd delegate."` to the response and then terminates the pipeline. If another `Use` or `Run` delegate is added after the `Run` delegate, it's not called.

## Branch the middleware pipeline

[Map](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.mapextensions.map) extensions are used as a convention for branching the pipeline. `Map` branches the request pipeline based on matches of the given request path. If the request path starts with the given path, the branch is executed.

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

app.Map("/map1", HandleMapTest1);

app.Map("/map2", HandleMapTest2);

app.Run(async context =>
{
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello from non-Map delegate.");
});

app.Run();

static void HandleMapTest1(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.Run(async context =>
    {
        await context.Response.WriteAsync("Map Test 1");
    });
}

static void HandleMapTest2(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.Run(async context =>
    {
        await context.Response.WriteAsync("Map Test 2");
    });
}
```

The following table shows the requests and responses from `http://localhost:1234` using the preceding code.

| Request             | Response                     |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------- |
| localhost:1234      | Hello from non-Map delegate. |
| localhost:1234/map1 | Map Test 1                   |
| localhost:1234/map2 | Map Test 2                   |
| localhost:1234/map3 | Hello from non-Map delegate. |

When `Map` is used, the matched path segments are removed from `HttpRequest.Path` and appended to `HttpRequest.PathBase` for each request.

`Map` supports nesting, for example:

```csharp
app.Map("/level1", level1App => {
    level1App.Map("/level2a", level2AApp => {
        // "/level1/level2a" processing
    });
    level1App.Map("/level2b", level2BApp => {
        // "/level1/level2b" processing
    });
});
```

`Map` can also match multiple segments at once:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

app.Map("/map1/seg1", HandleMultiSeg);

app.Run(async context =>
{
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello from non-Map delegate.");
});

app.Run();

static void HandleMultiSeg(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.Run(async context =>
    {
        await context.Response.WriteAsync("Map Test 1");
    });
}
```

[MapWhen](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.mapwhenextensions.mapwhen) branches the request pipeline based on the result of the given predicate. Any predicate of type `Func<HttpContext, bool>` can be used to map requests to a new branch of the pipeline. In the following example, a predicate is used to detect the presence of a query string variable `branch`:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

app.MapWhen(context => context.Request.Query.ContainsKey("branch"), HandleBranch);

app.Run(async context =>
{
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello from non-Map delegate.");
});

app.Run();

static void HandleBranch(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.Run(async context =>
    {
        var branchVer = context.Request.Query["branch"];
        await context.Response.WriteAsync($"Branch used = {branchVer}");
    });
}
```

The following table shows the requests and responses from `http://localhost:1234` using the previous code:

| Request                       | Response                       |
| :---------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| `localhost:1234`              | `Hello from non-Map delegate.` |
| `localhost:1234/?branch=main` | `Branch used = main`           |

[UseWhen](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.usewhenextensions.usewhen) also branches the request pipeline based on the result of the given predicate. Unlike with `MapWhen`, this branch is rejoined to the main pipeline if it doesn't short-circuit or contain a terminal middleware:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

app.UseWhen(context => context.Request.Query.ContainsKey("branch"),
    appBuilder => HandleBranchAndRejoin(appBuilder));

app.Run(async context =>
{
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello from non-Map delegate.");
});

app.Run();

void HandleBranchAndRejoin(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    var logger = app.ApplicationServices.GetRequiredService<ILogger<Program>>(); 

    app.Use(async (context, next) =>
    {
        var branchVer = context.Request.Query["branch"];
        logger.LogInformation("Branch used = {branchVer}", branchVer);

        // Do work that doesn't write to the Response.
        await next();
        // Do other work that doesn't write to the Response.
    });
}
```

In the preceding example, a response of `Hello from non-Map delegate.` is written for all requests. If the request includes a query string variable `branch`, its value is logged before the main pipeline is rejoined.

## Built-in middleware

ASP.NET Core ships with the following middleware components. The *Order* column provides notes on middleware placement in the request processing pipeline and under what conditions the middleware may terminate request processing. When a middleware short-circuits the request processing pipeline and prevents further downstream middleware from processing a request, it's called a *terminal middleware*. For more information on short-circuiting, see the [Create a middleware pipeline with IApplicationBuilder](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/middleware/?view=aspnetcore-7.0#create-a-middleware-pipeline-with-iapplicationbuilder) section.
