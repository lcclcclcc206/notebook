Control the visibility of elements, without modifying their display, with visibility utilities.

Set the `visibility` of elements with our visibility utilities. These utility classes do not modify the `display` value at all and do not affect layout – `.invisible` elements still take up space in the page.

Apply `.visible` or `.invisible` as needed.

```html
<div class="visible">...</div>
<div class="invisible">...</div>
```
