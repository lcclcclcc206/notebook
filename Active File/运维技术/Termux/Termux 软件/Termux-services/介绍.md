[termux-services](https://github.com/termux/termux-services) contains a set of scripts for controlling services. Instead of putting commands in ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile, they can be started and stopped with termux-services.

To install termux-services, run

```
pkg install termux-services
```

and then restart termux so that the service-daemon is started.

To then enable and run a service, run

```
sv-enable <service>
```

If you only want to run it once, run

```
sv up <service>
```

To later stop a service, run:

```
sv down <service>
```

Or to disable it

```
sv-disable <service>
```
