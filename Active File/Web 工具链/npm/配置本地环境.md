# About npm CLI versions

The npm command line interface (CLI) is released on a regular cadence. We recommend installing the release that supports your workflow:

- [latest release](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm-versions#the-latest-release-of-npm): the most recent stable version.

## The `latest` release of npm

The `latest` release of npm is the most recent stable version. When you install Node.js, npm is automatically installed. However, npm is released more frequently than Node.js, so to install the latest stable version of npm, on the command line, run:

```
npm install npm@latest -g
```

# Downloading and installing Node.js and npm

To publish and install packages to and from the public npm registry or a private npm registry, you must install Node.js and the npm command line interface using either a Node version manager or a Node installer. **We strongly recommend using a Node version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install Node.js and npm.** We do not recommend using a Node installer, since the Node installation process installs npm in a directory with local permissions and can cause permissions errors when you run npm packages globally.

> to download the latest version of npm, on the command line, run the following command:
>
> ```
> npm install -g npm
> ```

## Checking your version of npm and Node.js

To see if you already have Node.js and npm installed and check the installed version, run the following commands:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

## Using a Node version manager to install Node.js and npm

Node version managers allow you to install and switch between multiple versions of Node.js and npm on your system so you can test your applications on multiple versions of npm to ensure they work for users on different versions.

### Windows Node version managers

- [nodist](https://github.com/marcelklehr/nodist)
- [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)

### OSX or Linux Node version managers

- [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
- [n](https://github.com/tj/n)

## Using a Node installer to install Node.js and npm

If you are unable to use a Node version manager, you can use a Node installer to install both Node.js and npm on your system.

- [Node.js installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [NodeSource installer](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions)

If you use Linux, we recommend that you use a NodeSource installer.
